I am currently employed at Perception Team, Weride Inc., where I am primarily focused on computer vision and autonomous driving projects such as metric learning, object re-identification, and scene understanding. In 2022, I completed my M.S. degree at the [National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology (NELVT)](http://idm.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. [Ling-Yu Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hsXZOgIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior to that, I earned a B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2019.
